Daily PySpark Challenges

this repo is my personal log of daily spark challenges.
the goal is to build strong, real-world data engineering problem-solving skills using pyspark — from basics to production-level scenarios.

what you’ll find here

daily spark challenges: short and focused problems that cover joins, aggregations, window functions, optimizations, etc.

real-world patterns: scenarios inspired by data engineering workflows — data cleaning, ETL, partitioning, shuffles, caching, and more.

progress tracking: each folder represents a day’s challenge, showing both the problem statement and my approach.
